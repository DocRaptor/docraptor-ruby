# Swagger Codegen Ignore
# Generated by swagger-codegen https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# As an example, the C# client generator defines ApiClient.cs.
# You can make changes and tell Swagger Codgen to ignore just this file by uncommenting the following line:
#ApiClient.cs

# You can match any string of characters against a directory, file or extension with a single asterisk (*):
#foo/*/qux
# The above matches foo/bar/qux and foo/baz/qux, but not foo/bar/baz/qux

# You can recursively match patterns against a directory, file or extension with a double asterisk (**):
#foo/**/qux
# This matches foo/bar/qux, foo/baz/qux, and foo/bar/baz/qux

# You can also negate patterns with an exclamation (!).
# For example, you can ignore all files in a docs folder with the file extension .md:
#docs/*.md
# Then explicitly reverse the ignore rule for a single file:
#!docs/README.md


# This seems to be a script related to developing openapi-generator and making
# new test APIs.
git_push.sh

# Don't ignore this because we want to review the generated content to see if we
# should update our own readme similarly. The most common example is an update
# to the supported runtime versions, but it could also be an update to the
# recommended usage that we would want to use.
!README.md

# Don't ignore this because we want to know about new files that the generator
# ignores.
!.gitignore
